## Ethos
There is no perfect set of survey questions and there will be many ways to rephrase them to remove ambiguities or to emphasise certain dimensions of engineering leadership. Suggestions are welcome, especially if certain questions are confusing or fail to yield useful insights. There will certainly be some very good question statements which have not been included in the survey that would highlight a very important aspect of engineering leadership. The software engineering domain is ever-changing and so new paradigms will emerge over time which might signal the need for wholesale changes to the survey.

These survey questions are open-sourced for 2 main reasons:
1. So that it may be improved over time via comments and individual contributions
2. Engineering Leaders s are more likely to engage with a survey that is open-sourced without any hidden motives

## Suggestions 
* All suggestions for modification or improvements to individual questions are welcome as a Pull Request.
* Structural changes or suggestions requiring an element of nuanced thinking can be made by commenting via the 'issues' tab.

Suggestions are particularly welcome from engineer leaders based on their personal experiences of what is important to them in their work.

Suggestions from non-engineers who do not have a GitHub account are welcome via a direct message to the author's [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/johndurrant/) account. 

## Frequency of Changes
It is suspected that there will be frequent changes during the early stages of this project (alpha stages) as tweaks are made in response to 'in the field' exposure and feedback. Once the project is beyond the alpha phase, changes will likely be much rarer as the aim will be to reach a stable set of question statements.

## Version Control
The project will be version controlled. See [VERSION CONTROL](/VERSION-CONTROL.md).
