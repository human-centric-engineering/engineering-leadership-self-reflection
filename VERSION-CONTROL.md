# Version Control

The project will be version controlled and aligned with Semantic Versioning: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH

0.0.1 will be the first alpha release
1.0.1 will be the first production release

* A PATCH is a change in the spelling or syntax of a question which doesn't change its fundamental meaning or a change in the surrounding documentation.
* A MINOR change is a change to a question which changes the potential interpretation of a question but which aims at assessing a similar sentiment.
* A MAJOR change is required when questions are completely rewritten with entirely different meanings.

During the alpha stage, MAJOR changes will be treated as MINOR changes as there is expected to be a high frequency of such modifications during alpha.
